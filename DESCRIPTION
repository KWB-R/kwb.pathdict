Description: This package provides functions to work with
    what I call path dictionaries. Path dictionaries are lists defining
    file and folder paths. In order not to repeat sub-paths, placeholders
    can be used. The package provides functions to find duplicated
    sub-paths and to define placeholders accordingly.

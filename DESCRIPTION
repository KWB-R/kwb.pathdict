Description: This package provides functions to work with what I call path 
    dictionaries. Path dictionaries are lists defining file and folder paths. 
    In order not to repeat sub-paths, placeholders can be used. The package 
    provides functions to find duplicated sub-paths and to define placeholders 
    accordingly.
